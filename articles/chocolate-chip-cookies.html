<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<!-- My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
for he has looked with favor on his humble servant.
From this day all generations will call me blessed
the Almighty has done great things for me
and holy is his Name.
He has mercy on those who fear Him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of his arm
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones
and has lifted up the humble.
He has filled the hungry with good things
and the rich he has sent away empty.
He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he has remembered his promise of mercy
the promise he made to our fathers
to Abraham and his children for ever.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
Amen. Alleluia -->
