<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<!-- <hr> -->

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>3 chicken breasts  (I like to cut the breasts in half so there are 6 pieces.) </li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>4 tablespoons of flour</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 cup of panko bread crumbs</li>
<li>1/2 cup of parmesan, shredded</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of olive oil </li>
<li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
<li>1 cup of marinara sauce </li>
<li>3/4 cup of shredded mozzarella </li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Preheat oven to 375˚F.</p></li>
<li><p>Season chicken with salt and pepper.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix the bread crumbs and the parmesan cheese in a shallow bowl. In another shallow bowl, pour the flour. And in a third bowl, beat the eggs.</p></li>
<li><p>Drench each chicken piece in the flour, then the eggs, then the bread crumb mixture. </p></li>
<li><p>In a large pan melt the butter and olive oil together. Add the coated chicken breasts to the pan and cook for about 3 minutes on each side. Note, the inside will still be raw. This is just to brown the crust.</p></li>
<li><p>Place chicken breasts on baking sheet. Top with marinara sauce and shredded mozzarella. </p></li>
<li><p>Bake for 18-20 minutes. </p></li>
<li><p>Serve with angel hair pasta and enjoy! </p></li>
</ol>

<!-- My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
for he has looked with favor on his humble servant.
From this day all generations will call me blessed
the Almighty has done great things for me
and holy is his Name.
He has mercy on those who fear Him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of his arm
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones
and has lifted up the humble.
He has filled the hungry with good things
and the rich he has sent away empty.
He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he has remembered his promise of mercy
the promise he made to our fathers
to Abraham and his children for ever.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
Amen. Alleluia -->
