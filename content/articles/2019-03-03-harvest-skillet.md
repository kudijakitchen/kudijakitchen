## Ingredients
- olive oil
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

- 4 slices thick-cut bacon, cooked and chopped
- 3 cups Brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered
- 1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch cubes

- 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into 3/4 inch cubes
- 4 cloves garlic, minced 
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions
- Heat olive oil in pan on medium-high. Add chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook until chicken is cooked through, about five minutes. Transfer to a plate when cooked.
