- Preheat oven to 450ÂºF. 
- Pierce potatoes with a fork 5-10 times per potato. Place on baking sheet and cook for 45-50 minutes, until soft. 
- To prepare the salsa, dice tomatoes and onion. Transfer to a bowl. Chop cilantro and add to bowl as well. Add juice from limes and salt and pepper to taste. Mix together and set aside.
- To prepare the guacamole, scoop avocado into a bowl and mash. Add onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and 1/3 of the salsa mix. Mix well and set aside.
