## Ingredients
- 1/2 lb chicken, diced 
- 1 green pepper
- 1 red onion 
- 1 cup barbecue sauce 
- 2 cups cheddar or mozzarella shredded cheese 
- 6 small pizza crusts (homemade or store bought) 
- 2 tablespoons olive oil 
- Salt and pepper to taste


## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 450ËšF or whatever temperature is required for your dough. (Make sure to follow dough directions. Some need to be pre-baked and others can go right in with desired toppings.) 

2. In a pan, warm one tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the diced chicken, salt and pepper. Cook until chicken is cooked through (about 5-7 minutes). 

3. In the meantime, dice green pepper and red onion. Set aside. 

4. Brush the pizza crusts with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Do not drench! 

5. Spread barbecue sauce evenly amongst the six crusts. Top with shredded cheese, cooked chicken, green pepper and onion. 

6. Bake for 8 minutes and enjoy! 

7. Optional: Add red pepper flakes for an extra kick!
