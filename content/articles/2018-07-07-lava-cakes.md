## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons of butter (plus a little extra)
- 2 tablespoons of sugar (plus a little extra)
- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoons flour
- Pinch of salt

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 475˚F.

2. Grease two oven safe custard cups with extra butter. Put extra sugar in each cup and turn cups sideways coating the butter. Dump extra sugar. 

3. In a bowl, mix the measured butter and sugar. Once smooth, beat in eggs until mixture foams.

4. Add flour and salt to mixture and beat until mixed through.

5. In another bowl, melt the chocolate.

6. Mix the melted chocolate into the other ingredients and stir so that it’s all combined.

7. Pour batter evenly into the custard cups. Place on baking tray. 

8. Bake for 11 minutes or until the tops are just set but still jiggly. 

9. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, flip custard cups and tap the bottom of the cups so the cakes fall out. 

10. Serve immediately, preferably with ice cream!
