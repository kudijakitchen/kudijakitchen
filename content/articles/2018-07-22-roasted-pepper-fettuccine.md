## Ingredients
- 3 red bell peppers
- 1 tablespoon garlic, minced
- 3/4 a box of fettuccine (about 12 ounces)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced 
- 1 tablespoon of butter
- 1/2 cup chicken broth 
- 1/8 cup heavy cream
- 1/8 cup milk
- 1/2 cup parmesan, shredded 
- 1/2 tablespoon parsley
- 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
- Salt and pepper to taste


## Instructions
1. Set oven to broil. Cut red peppers into fourths and remove seeds and stems. On a baking sheet lined with foil, place the red pepper pieces skin side up. Broil for about 12 minutes (skin should be mostly black.) 

2. When finished, place red pepper pieces in a ziplock bag and seal. Let sit for 10 minutes. Remove from bag and remove skins. They should peel off with your fingers. Chop peppers and set aside.

3. Cook fettuccine according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

4. In a large pot, heat olive oil. Add onion and cook until tender. Add garlic for the last minute or so. 

5. In a food processor, add the roasted red peppers, garlic and onion. Purée.

6. Back in the large pot, melt the butter. Pour the red pepper purée into the pot and add the broth, cream and milk. Stir about 3 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. 

7. Remove from heat and add parmesan, parsley and red pepper flakes. Stir until combined and then add fettuccine noodles. 

8. Serve immediately and enjoy! Garnish with extra parmesan, parsley and/or red pepper flakes.
