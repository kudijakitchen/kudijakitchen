## Steak
### Ingredients
**Steak**
- 1 lb flank steak, sliced into strips
- 1 lb baby yellow and red potatoes, quartered
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon rosemary
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- Salt and pepper
- Crushed red chili pepper flakes

**Marinade**
- 1/3 cup soy sauce 
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Sriracha 
- Fresh cracked pepper

### Instructions
1. In a large bowl, combine the steak strips with soy sauce, olive oil, pepper, and Sriracha. Set aside to marinate while you cook potatoes.

2. In a large pan over medium-high heat, mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. When butter is melted, add potatoes. Cook for about ten minutes until fork tender. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

3. Keep the same pan over medium heat and add remaining 2 tablespoons butter, garlic, rosemary, oregano, salt, pepper and red chili pepper flakes. Lay the steak strips the pan. Keep the remaining marinade for later. Cook, flipping occasionally, until it is to your desired temperature. (We like ours medium-well so we cook for about 6-8 minutes.)

4. Right before the steak is done, you can stir in the reserved marinade if you like, and cook for one minute. Add the potatoes back to the pan and heat through. 

5. Remove from heat and serve immediately. Enjoy!
