## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons of olive oil, separated 
- 1/2 lb chicken, diced
- Salt and Pepper, to taste
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic 
- 3 cups spinach 
- 3/4 cup ricotta cheese 
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese 
- 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes
- 1/2 teaspoon of oregano 
- Pizza crust (we used store-bought) 

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.

2. In a large pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add chicken, garlic, salt and pepper. Cook 5-7 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Set aside.

3. In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add spinach and cook until wilted. Set aside. (The spinach may have a lot of excess liquid. I like to place on a paper towel and use tongs to ring out liquid.) 

4. In a small bowl, mix together ricotta cheese, red pepper flakes and oregano. Set aside.

5. Brush the pizza crust with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Then coat the crust with the ricotta mix. Add mozzarella cheese on top along with chicken and spinach. Sprinkle with extra red pepper flakes and/or oregano.

6. Bake 8-12 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is golden. Enjoy!
